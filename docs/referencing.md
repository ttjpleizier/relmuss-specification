* Do NOT use capitalization, hence: `gen.` rather than `Gen.` for the book of Genenis.
* Add the `.` (dot) to separate name of the book and chapter
* Do NOT use spaces, hence: `1sam.` rather than `1 Sam.` for the first book of Samuel.

## Liturgical scripts (`sp-l`, `mu-l`, `sp-p`)

The following liturgical scripts can be used. If necessary, new types should be added and documented accordingly. The categories below are for quick orientation.

### Beginnings and endings of worship services

* `ref:blessing`: includes various versions of blessings. Use this tag for the blessing at the end of the service.

* `ref:votum`: encouraging and confessional words, usually at the beginning of a Reformed worship service

### Other common texts

* `ref:creed`: for Nicene and Apostolic creeds or other credal texts introduced as such. Creeds can also be sung, if so, use references to hymnal and vers-number.
* `ref:lordsprayer`: use when the Lord's prayer is said or sung.

### Sacraments and other ritual practices

* `ref:communion`: forms, prayers (eucharistic prayers) and other scripted language concerning the celebration of the Lord's Supper, Holy Communion or the Eucharist

Disclaimer: there is a problem with new editions (Op Toonhoogte 2015, Gereformeerd kerkboek 2017). They come in various versions. In this phase of annotating we do not distinghuish between versions though this may result in a wrong numbering. The most recent version is leading for the range of numbers.
